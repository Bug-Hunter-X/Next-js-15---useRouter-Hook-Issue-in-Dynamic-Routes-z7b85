# Next.js 15 - useRouter Hook Issue in Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior with the `useRouter` hook in Next.js 15 when used within dynamic routes.  The issue manifests as the `useRouter` hook returning an incomplete router object, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Description

The `useRouter` hook in a dynamically routed component (e.g., `/about/[id]`) does not provide the expected properties and methods.  This prevents certain functionality that relies on the router object from working correctly.  

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about` (or a dynamic route if implemented). 
5. Observe the console output (errors or missing properties of `router` object).

## Solution
The solution involves using a more robust approach to handling dynamic routes, ensuring the client-side routing behaves as expected, and properly handles the different scenarios within the dynamic route or using getServerSideProps.
